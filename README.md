## Abstract
This project presents a deep learning-based approach for automatic detection of brain tumors from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, we develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that can accurately segment and classify brain tumors. Our results demonstrate the potential of deep learning algorithms in improving diagnostic accuracy and reducing false positives in brain tumor detection.
